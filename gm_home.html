About the artist:
Grace Marlowe is 18 year old female artist born in North Carolina, when she moved to Virginia Beach at the
age of 18. She met up with Jake Lionetti, front man of the 90's inspired alternative rock band, Junk Mail.
The two instantly connected over there love of music. Grace first played bass to fill in for Junk Mail from time to time
Then they were regularly scheduling gigs with Grace playing and singing her original songs and covers by her favorite bands
while accompanying Jake with his covers and originals too.
With the uncertainity of Junk Mail's band members, Jake took Grace into his friend from high school's studio, Jack Westcott
and began working on her single "Fade" while rehersing other songs for a potiental album or EP.
